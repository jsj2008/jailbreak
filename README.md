This is the repository that I will be using to document my progress and maintain the code used in my private iOS 10.X jailbreak and resources and research used for jailbreaks for previous versions of iOS.

# Daily Progress

* Wednesday, November 30th 2016 - 10:45 AM - Continued the review of [TaiG's](http://taig.com "TaiG Jailbreak") tool. The intentional abuse of internal Apple tools and services to reach arbitrary code execution. In the case of TaiG for iOS 8, the use of AFC or Apple File Conduit which is an internal service built into applications like iTunes, and responsible for the transfer of files from a computer to the filesystem of an iDevice over a USB cable with the use of USBMux.

* Wednesday, November 30th 2016 - 10:00 AM - Started the analysis of [TaiG's](http://taig.com "TaiG Jailbreak") tool used in the iOS 8.1.3 through iOS 8.4 jailbreak. I will be comparing the different exploits and methods used from each jailbreak for modern(ish) versions of iOS (6-10). Next step - Reach out to Jonathan for a possible interview. N.B. FileMon is amazing.

* Wednesday, November 30th 2016 - 9:15 AM - Compiled [Jonathan Levin's](https://newosxbook.com "Newosxbook.com") Jtool for ARM Cortex-A9 processor architecture on iPhone 4s for debugging of 32 bit binaries. Once compiled, I set up necessary keys for SSH access to iPhone 4s over wifi.
