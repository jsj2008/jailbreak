# iOS Jailbreaking and Security - Derek Foresman 

![Preview](Preview.png)

This is the repository that I will be using to document my progress and maintain the code used in my private iOS 10.X jailbreak and resources and research used for jailbreaks for previous versions of iOS.

# Daily Progress

* Started Github Repository to document my progress and manage all the code needed for my independent project

# Daily Reflection

* Tuesday, November 2016 - 
  
  ```How did you perform today?``` Today was the first day of the 3 week ColLab period. We focused on the principles of what the responsibilities of ColLabs and how to handle the time properly. The rubrics for successful projects were given with the first two best catagories left intentionally blank, which each filled with their own opinion of an excellent project. I added qualities I felt I would need to have a successful three weeks. I focused on time management and the responsibility of completing all assignments, reflections and updates on time with plenty of expressed effort.
  
 ```What factors contributed to your performance?``` A large driving factor in my personal project is the fact that I enjoy the logic behind the idea of a jailbreak. The idea of legally breaking something made to be secure for the purpose to make it even more resilient, has always interested me. The logic behind an iOS jailbreak is extremely complicated programmatically, but my extensive prior knowledge on the topic is very helpful as I don't need to spend a large amount of my time learning new methods.
