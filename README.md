This is the repository that I will be using to document my progress and maintain the code used in my private iOS 10.X jailbreak and resources and research used for jailbreaks for previous versions of iOS.

# Daily Updates

* Thursday, December 1st 2016 - 2:30 PM - I changed the direction of the day a little bit by starting to disassemble the binaries of the processes used by iTunes on a desktop operating system, that are responsible for the transfer of files over usb to specific directories on and iDevice. I loaded it into Hopper Disassembler to view the process behind the compiled binary since the source of it is owned by Apple and currently unavailable to the public.



* Thursday, December 1st 2016 - 1:30 PM - Reaching out to Jeff Benjamin [@JeffBenjam](https://twitter.com/JeffBenjam) of [9to5mac.com](https://9to5mac.com/). Jeff and 9to5Mac cover the most recent updates in the jailbreak scene. For people looking for more information on jailbreaking, [this](https://9to5mac.com/guides/jailbreak/) post provides useful information on the comcept. Check this page for the most accurate updates.

* Thursday, December 1st 2016 - 11:30 PM - Started reaching out to developers of popular Cydia tweaks. I have previously recorded podcasts with prominent developers like William Vabrinskas [@william_vab](https://twitter.com/william_vab), Matt Clarke [@matchstic](https://twitter.com/_Matchstic), Andy Wiik [@Andywiik](https://twitter.com/Andywiik), Brian Olencki [@bolencki13](https://twitter.com/bolencki13).

* Wednesday, November 30th 2016 - 10:45 AM - Continued the review of [TaiG's](http://taig.com "TaiG Jailbreak") tool from the article [here](http://www.newosxbook.com/articles/TaiG2.html "The Annotated guide to TaiG"). The intentional abuse of internal Apple tools and services to reach arbitrary code execution. In the case of TaiG for iOS 8, the use of AFC or Apple File Conduit which is an internal service built into applications like iTunes, and responsible for the transfer of files from a computer to the filesystem of an iDevice over a USB cable with the use of USBMux. Examined the difference in modified AMFI.kext responsible for file signature checks on iOS 7.1.2.

* Wednesday, November 30th 2016 - 10:00 AM - Started the analysis of [TaiG's](http://taig.com "TaiG Jailbreak") tool used in the iOS 8.1.3 through iOS 8.4 jailbreak. I will be comparing the different exploits and methods used from each jailbreak for modern(ish) versions of iOS (6-10). Next step - Reach out to Jonathan for a possible interview. N.B. FileMon is amazing.

* Wednesday, November 30th 2016 - 9:15 AM - Compiled [Jonathan Levin's](https://newosxbook.com "Newosxbook.com") Jtool for ARM Cortex-A9 processor architecture on iPhone 4s for debugging of 32 bit binaries. Once compiled, I set up necessary keys for SSH access to iPhone 4s over wifi.
